# HotTakeBot
A bot that tweets inane sports proclamations. Written in Python utilizing Twython.

Disclaimer: I don't know what I'm doing. This is a potentially overly-ambitious attempt to learn Python. Any usefulness is purely coincidental and/or a lucky accident. :)

I'm very open to tips and collaboration.
